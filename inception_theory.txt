What is Emmet?

Emmet is a plug in for many popular text editors which greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow, that allows for high-speed coding and editing.


Difference between Library and framework?

Both libraries and software frameworks are just a collection of reusable code written by others. However, libraries target a specific functionality, while a framework tries to provide everything
 required to develop a complete application.


What is CDN and why do we use it?

CDN is Content Delivery Network. It simply decreases server load and makes faster content delivery. Essentially, the content is spread out across several servers, as opposed to offloading them 
onto one large server.Since CDNs place servers as close to a group of users as possible, latency and packet loss are minimized due to a shorter distance traveled.



Why is React known as React?

React is known as “React” because it is meant to help developers build user interfaces that are fast and responsive, or “reactive.” The library was designed to “react” to changes in data. 
When data in a React application changes, the components that depend on that data are automatically updated, which allows for efficient and seamless updates to the user interface. The name “React” reflects this reactive nature of the library.



What is cross-0rigin in script tag?

The crossorigin attribute, valid on the <audio>, <img>, <link>, <script>, and <video> elements, provides support for CORS, 

CORS:-
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should 
permit loading resources.



What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?

React: React is a javascript library, designed for building better user interfaces.

React-DOM: React-DOM is a complimentary library to React which glues React to the browser DOM

React is responsible for creating views and ReactDOM is responsible to actually render UI in the browser.


What is the difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

In production mode, compression and minification of Javascript and other resources happens to reduce size of the code which is not the case when it comes to development mode. Performance will 
be much faster in production mode when compared to development mode.




Difference between async and defer:

Async Attribute:

When a script tag has the async attribute (<script async src="..."></script>), the browser will begin downloading the script immediately without pausing the HTML parsing.The script will be 
executed asynchronously as soon as it finishes downloading, which means it can execute independently of other scripts or the HTML document's parsing.However, the order of execution of async 
scripts is not guaranteed. Whichever script finishes downloading first will execute first.

Defer Attribute:

When a script tag has the defer attribute (<script defer src="..."></script>), the browser also starts downloading the script immediately, but it will wait to execute the script until the HTML 
parsing is complete.Multiple defer scripts will execute in the order they appear in the HTML.The defer attribute is commonly used when the script relies on the DOM being fully loaded, ensuring 
that the script executes after the HTML document has been parsed.
